# Revaltivistic-Engine

This is a special relativistics flight simulator, its visualization is controlled by a quaternion formulation of special relativity. It's currently only rigged for gamepad controls. The left and right joysticks are move and look around as usual, dpad down is match velocty and X is pause/unpause time. This project is very must still in development so don't be surprised if you find bugs ;)
